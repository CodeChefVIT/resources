OOPS is a concept that uses entities like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism etc and implements it by using objects. The major objective of OOPS is to reduce the repetition of code in a particular programme and reuse it so that less development time is required.

## How to start learning OOPS : 👈

Follow any one of the documentation or course provided above and after you are comfortable with the various concepts in OOPS you can start doing practice from the question bank provided in the resources after doing this much I think you are more than capable of answering all the questions related to OOPS.

## Why is Object Oriented Programming Important : 👈

📌 OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve — one object at a time.<br>
📌 Reuse of code through inheritance.<br>
📌 Modularity for easier troubleshooting.<br>
📌 Polymorphism Flexibility.<br>
📌 Objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier.
