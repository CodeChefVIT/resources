Software is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves some computational purpose. Software is considered to be collection of executable programming code, associated libraries and documentations. Software, when made for a specific requirement is called software product.

Engineering on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.

## Why is Software Engineering Important : ðŸ’¡

Software engineering is important because specific software is needed in almost every industry, in every business, and for every function. It becomes more important as time goes on â€“ if something breaks within your application portfolio, a quick, efficient, and effective fix needs to happen as soon as possible.<br>

Whatever you need software engineering to do â€“ it is something that is vitally important and that importance just keeps growing.
