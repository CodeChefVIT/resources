# Shell Scripting
<br>

A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a UNIX-based operating system. A shell script is usually created for command sequences in which a user has a need to use repeatedly in order to save time.
A bash (or shell) script is basically a program that allows the user to interact with the UNIX/Linux system by writing executable shell commands in a simple text file.
