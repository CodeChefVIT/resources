Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile](https://flutter.dev/docs), [web](https://flutter.dev/web), and [desktop](https://flutter.dev/desktop) from a single codebase.<br>
Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world([examples](https://flutter.dev/showcase)), and is free and open source.

## Why Flutter?

* **One Codebase, Every Platform**
* Integration, Flexibility and Scalability Capabilities
* Fast Development
* Expressive and Flexible UI
* Native Performance and Internationalised Flutter Libraries
* Great Range of pre-built Components
* Huge Widget Library
* Hot Reload

## Google is Not Your Friend

Just Kidding! Google is indeed your friend but for flutter developers, there is a better platform - [pub.dev](). You can great range of pre-built packages and plugins which can be used in your code to make your work easy. 

Whatever design you wanna make or any functionality you wanna implement which seems difficult will surely be possible using this.

pub.dev is a platform where you don't only get code, but you can also contribute by making your own packages and plugins.

# Flutter Web

In addition to mobile apps, Flutter supports the generation of web content rendered using standards-based web technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With web support, you can compile existing Flutter code written in Dart into a client experience that can be embedded in the browser and deployed to any web server. You can use all the features of Flutter, and you don’t need a browser plug-in.

## Getting Started

If you have gone through the above content, you already know how to make a website using Flutter because Flutter uses exactly the same codebase to render a functional WebApp as well.

## Some Differences

Though Flutter Web uses same codebase, but some things are handled differently in a Web App like routing, etc. Simple tutorials for these things can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33kyEzDMTZU&list=PLdTodMosi-Bxf___3xPh3_NS-on4dc0sJ).

## Deploying Flutter WebApps

Flutter Web sometimes seems quite tedious to deploy on a web server, but [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) has got you covered.

Netlify helps to deploy Flutter Web app in a few simple steps. Entire process to deploy a Flutter Web application can be found [here](https://medium.com/@D10100111001/flutter-web-netlify-continuous-deployment-the-right-way-in-2-minutes-f2ed4a4fcbf7).
