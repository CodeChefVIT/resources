React.js is an open-source JavaScript library by Facebook that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It’s used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components. 

## JSX :heart_eyes:

In React, instead of using regular JavaScript for templating, it uses JSX. JSX is a simple JavaScript that allows HTML quoting and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents. HTML syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of React Framework. We can also write in pure old JavaScript.

## Who uses React? :raising_hand:
Facebook, Netflix, Instagram, Netlify, Dropbox and many more Tech Giants.

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
Not yet! Now that you've explored React, you can either learn [React Native](./REACT-NATIVE.md) or [Flutter](./FLUTTER.md) and start developing mobile apps. 

### Why Flutter?
Flutter and React have really similar State Management. A lot of other things also feel familiar so you won't really find it hard to learn Flutter.

You could also explore [VueJS](./VUEJS.md) as it is pretty similar to React.

We hope you now know the roadmap to being a professional React Developer :v:
