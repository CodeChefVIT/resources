By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is **Git**. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source.

Git is the best choice for most software teams today.
