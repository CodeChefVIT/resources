## Render Settings 

Render settings determine the following characteristics: <br>
-Output frame rate <br>
-Duration <br>
-Resolution <br>
-Layer quality <br>

Output module settings—which are applied after render settings—determine post-rendering characteristics such as the following: <br>
-Output format <br>
-Compression options <br>
-Cropping <br>
-Whether to embed a link to the project in the output file <br>

**STEPS FOR RENDERING** <br> 
1. Render and export a movie using the render queue. <br>
     - Choose Composition > Add To Render Queue. <br>
     - Drag the composition to the Render Queue panel. <br>

*AlTERNATIVE* : Render and export with Adobe Media Encoder. <br>

2. Choosing formats and output settings. Supported output formats <br>
     - Video for Windows (AVI; Windows only)<br>
     - QuickTime (MOV)<br>
           -- In the Render Queue panel, select QuickTime (MOV) encoding and compression settings. <br>
           -- In the QuickTime Options dialog box, choose a codec and set options according to the specific codec and your needs and Quality<br>

*Note*: A higher Quality setting produces better image quality but results in a bigger movie file.  <br> <br>

### *Resulting a much bigger File than Expected?* <br>
**HANDBRAKE IT!**
HandBrake : The open source video transcoder is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs.
NOTE: This will result in compressed size version of your video with just minor changes in quality.
