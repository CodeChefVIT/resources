Deep Learning is an Artificial Intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. DL is a subset of ML in AI that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled, also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
