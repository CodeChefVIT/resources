OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library
  
## Getting Started
- You can pip install OpenCV using:
```bash
$ pip install opencv-python
```

- Unable to install openCV? :confused: Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h4TIVO01XI)

## Done? :disappointed_relieved:
If you have gone through the resources faithfully and completed some projects, give yourself a pat on the back. You can now call yourself a OpenCV developer.

If you want to explore the path of Computer Vision further, look into [YOLO](https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html) and [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/), you could also check out [TeachableMachine].(https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
