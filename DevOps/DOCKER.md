Docker is a set of platform as a service products that delivers software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.

## Docker Compose
Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Compose works in all environments: production, staging, development, testing, as well as CI workflows. With Docker Compose, you can easily deploy multiple containers with a single command.
